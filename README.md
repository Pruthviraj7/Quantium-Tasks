## Presented and Analyze by- Pruthvirajsinh Solanki

### Project Objective:
During my virtual internship at Quantium, I undertook a key task that involved conducting a comprehensive analysis of the chip category. The primary objective was to provide strategic recommendations for the impending category review, led by Julia, the Category Manager. This task was instrumental in honing my analytical skills and applying them to real-world business scenarios.

### Project Overview:
During my virtual internship at Forage with Quantium, I undertook a pivotal project involving retail strategy and analytics. This marked my inaugural project, dealing with a sizable dataset of approximately 2.5 lakhs rows. The primary tools utilized for data analysis were Power BI and Excel, with a focus on meticulous data cleaning and insightful visualizations.

### Project Requirements:

Meticulously examined transaction data for inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers using Power BI.
Implemented data cleaning processes to ensure the dataset's integrity.

 * Data Integration:
 Employed Power BI to scrutinize customer data, addressing issues and ensuring seamless data integration.
Merged transaction and customer data effectively for a consolidated dataset.

 * Feature Engineering:
 Utilized Power BI to derive additional features, such as pack size and brand name, to enhance the dataset's richness.

 * Metric Definition:
 Defined relevant metrics using Power BI, including criteria for customer segmentation and drivers of sales.
Explored metrics such as purchase frequency, average spend per transaction, and pack size preferences.

 * Commercial Application:
 Ensured that insights derived from the analysis had practical applications for strategic decision-making.
Formulated a clear and actionable strategy, leveraging Power BI's capabilities, to support Julia in the category review.
